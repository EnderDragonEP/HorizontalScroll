It is built on the open-source components below. The released `HorizontalScroll.exe` contains all of them; running from source only needs them installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## GPL-3.0 components

PyQt6 is Copyright (c) Riverbank Computing Limited. PyQt6-Fluent-Widgets and PyQt6-Frameless-Window are Copyright (c) zhiyiYo.
They are used under the GNU General Public License v3.0, the same license as Horizontal Scroll; its full text is in [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Qt (LGPL-3.0)

The exe contains the Qt 6 libraries, Copyright (c) The Qt Company Ltd. and other contributors, used under the
[GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).
Qt's source code is available from <https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/>.
Because Horizontal Scroll's complete source code and build script are public, you can rebuild the exe with a modified version of Qt.

## Python (PSF License Agreement)

The exe contains the Python runtime and parts of its standard library, used under the
[PSF License Agreement](https://docs.python.org/3.12/license.html).

Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 Python Software Foundation; All Rights Reserved.

## PyInstaller bootloader

The exe starts through PyInstaller's bootloader, licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later with this exception:

> In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects; for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when not linked into a combined executable.)
